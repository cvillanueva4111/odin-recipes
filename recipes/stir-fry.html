    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This will show you how to make a stir fry.</p>
    <p>Kind of making it up as I go but oh well.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs (sliced then
            cut into bit size chunks)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 small bunch green onions (thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken in a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Let sit 
            while you prep the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl or large liquid measuring cup, combine the three-quarters 
            of the green onions, the remaining 3 tablespoons soy sauce, hoisin, garlic, 
            ginger, and vinegar. Set near the stove. Reserve the remaining green onions for serving.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook noodles until they are about 1 to 2 minutes 
            from done, according to package instructions. They should be very al dente, still a little too 
            firm to eat, but not excessively hard and chewy. Drain and toss with 1/2 tablespoon of the oil 
            to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1/2 tablespoon oil. Once the oil is hot, add the 
            chicken. Cook until golden and fully cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove to a plate.</li>
        <li>To the now-empty skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add the vegetables and cook until
            they begin to brown and soften but are still fairly crisp, about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add half the scallion mixture and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the noodles. Cook, using tongs to toss the noodles and coat them with the sauce, for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, sriracha, chicken, and remaining scallion mixture.</li>
        <li>Continue to stir fry and toss the noodles, until the eggs are cooked through and the noodles are tender,
            1 to 2 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Sprinkle with the reserved green onions.</li>

    </ol>
